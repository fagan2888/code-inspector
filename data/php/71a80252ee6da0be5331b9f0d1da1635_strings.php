			<strong>The Best App Ever!</strong>
			The best app I\'ve downloaded! It\'s also such a blessing to me to hear from God wherever I am. The daily reading plans are amazing and keep me focussed in God\'s Holy Word & the search engine totally rocks! The amount of references it brings up, it\'s the Bible & a great concordance all in one! May God bless everyone who has created this application and every one who downloads it! Come Quickly Lord!

			<strong>Does what it does, well.</strong>
			You\'ll find this application not only very compact and intuitive, but also easy to use. Navigating to a particular chapter in the Bible is easy, and the words are printed in three easy-to-read sizes and any translation you want. If you want to apply the Bible in your life this is a good start too. There is a reading plan accessible from the main screen. Not much but it\'s a good start. This app is also totally free from ads-- I found that alone refreshing.

			<strong>Great app</strong>
			This free Bible app is excellent. It offers all of the most popular translations. There are many other great features available, such as daily reading plans. I recommend this app for anyone who is interested in reading the Bible.

			<strong>Amazing App!</strong>
			I love this app! It never freezes or doesn\'t work for me. Its great when I want to read the bible at any moment of the day and all the translations are wonderful. Thanks for making this app!

		<h3>Should I Create a Group? <span>Reasons to Consider:</span></h3>

		<h4>Our organization is hosting a conference where we want to use YouVersion Live.</h4>
		<p><strong>Yes.</strong> Creating a group is required to use YouVersion Live. Just use the name of your event as the name of your group.</p>
		<h4>Our Bible Study group would like to post content for our members to access during the week.</h4>
		<p><strong>Yes.</strong> You can create an event that will be accessible during the timeframe you specify, and your members can use it to find specific notes, Scripture references, ask and answer questions based on the reading material, and more.</p>
		<h4>I want to see what my friends are doing on YouVersion.</h4>
		<p><strong>No.</strong> A group isn\'t the way to go in this case. There\'s an easy way to do this though&mdash;just use the follow button on your friends\' profiles.</p>
		<h4>I want to create a private group that only people I know can join.</h4>

	<h2>Relevancy</h2>
	<p>In generations past, the access people had to the Bible was very limited. Today, this is no longer the case. However, many people who have access to the Bible think its message does not apply to their lives. At the same time, there are others who believe there is a connection between the Bible and their every day experiences.</p>
	<h2>Information Revolution</h2>
	<p>Over the last decade, the Internet has brought about a revolution which empowers people like never before. With the ability to share, contribute, create, broadcast and communicate, it\'s easy to express who we are and what we believe with the rest of the world.</p>
	<h2>YouVersion</h2>
	<p>Since its start in 1996, LifeChurch.tv\'s purpose has been to lead people to become fully devoted followers of Christ. In doing so, we have looked for new ways to help people connect the Bible to their daily lives. Our methods have changed over the years as we\'ve incorporated various technologies and strategies. But at the core, our focus remains on relevancy as we consistently strive to demonstrate and teach people how God\'s Word relates to everyone, no matter where they are in life.</p>
	<p>YouVersion represents a new frontier in LifeChurch.tv\'s efforts. We aren\'t just building a tool to impact the world using innovative technology, more importantly, we are engaging people into relationships with God as they discover the relevance the Bible has for their lives.</p>
