(defn odds-ratio
"
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio

Definition in terms of group-wise odds

The odds ratio is the ratio of the odds of an event occurring in one group to the odds of it occurring in another group, or to a sample-based estimate of that ratio.


Suppose that in a sample of 100 men, 90 have drunk wine in the previous week, while in a sample of 100 women only 20 have drunk wine in the same period. The odds of a man drinking wine are 90 to 10, or 9:1, while the odds of a woman drinking wine are only 20 to 80, or 1:4 = 0.25:1. The odds ratio is thus 9/0.25, or 36, showing that men are much more likely to drink wine than women. 

Relation to statistical independence

If X and Y are independent, their joint probabilities can be expressed in terms of their marginal probabilities.  In this case, the odds ratio equals one, and conversely the odds ratio can only equal one if the joint probabilities can be factored in this way. Thus the odds ratio equals one if and only if X and Y are independent.

(defn correlation-ratio 
"
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_ratio

In statistics, the correlation ratio is a measure of the relationship between the statistical dispersion within individual categories and the dispersion across the whole population or sample. i.e. the weighted variance of the category means divided by the variance of all samples.

Example

Suppose there is a distribution of test scores in three topics (categories):

    * Algebra: 45, 70, 29, 15 and 21 (5 scores)
    * Geometry: 40, 20, 30 and 42 (4 scores)
    * Statistics: 65, 95, 80, 70, 85 and 73 (6 scores).

Then the subject averages are 36, 33 and 78, with an overall average of 52.

The sums of squares of the differences from the subject averages are 1952 for Algebra, 308 for Geometry and 600 for Statistics, adding to 2860, while the overall sum of squares of the differences from the overall average is 9640. The difference between these of 6780 is also the weighted sum of the square of the differences between the subject averages and the overall average:

    5(36 − 52)2 + 4(33 − 52)2 + 6(78 − 52)2 = 6780

This gives

    eta^2 =6780/9640=0.7033

suggesting that most of the overall dispersion is a result of differences between topics, rather than within topics. Taking the square root

    eta = sqrt 6780/9640=0.8386

Observe that for η = 1 the overall sample dispersion is purely due to dispersion among the categories and not at all due to dispersion within the individual categories. For a quick comprehension simply imagine all Algebra, Geometry, and Statistics scores being the same respectively, e.g. 5 times 36, 4 times 33, 6 times 78.

(defn correlation-linearity-test

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_ratio

It is worth noting that if the relationship between values of  and values of overline y_x is linear (which is certainly true when there are only two possibilities for x) this will give the same result as the square of the correlation coefficient, otherwise the correlation ratio will be larger in magnitude. It can therefore be used for judging non-linear relationships.

In statistics, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient or Spearman's rho, is a non-parametric measure of correlation – that is, it assesses how well an arbitrary monotonic function could describe the relationship between two variables, without making any other assumptions about the particular nature of the relationship between the variables. Certain other measures of correlation are parametric in the sense of being based on possible relationships of a parameterised form, such as a linear relationship.

    Ri = sum Rij

and the mean value of these total ranks is

    Rbar = 1/2 m (n + 1)

The sum of squared deviations, S, is defined as

    S=sum1-n (Ri - Rbar)

and then Kendall's W is defined as[1]

    W= 12S / m^2(n^3-n)

If the test statistic W is 1, then all the survey respondents have been unanimous, and each respondent has assigned the same order to the list of concerns. If W is 0, then there is no overall trend of agreement among the respondents, and their responses may be regarded as essentially random. Intermediate values of W indicate a greater or lesser degree of unanimity among the various responses.

Legendre[2] discusses a variant of the W statistic which accommodates ties in the rankings and also describes methods of making significance tests based on W.

The Sørensen index, also known as Sørensen’s similarity coefficient, is a statistic used for comparing the similarity of two samples. where A and B are the species numbers in samples A and B, respectively, and C is the number of species shared by the two samples. 

 The Sørensen index is identical to Dice's coefficient which is always in [0, 1] range. Sørensen index used as a distance measure, 1 − QS, is identical to Hellinger distance and Bray–Curtis dissimilarity.

The Sørensen coefficient is mainly useful for ecological community data (e.g. Looman & Campbell, 1960[3]). Justification for its use is primarily empirical rather than theoretical (although it can be justified theoretically as the intersection of two fuzzy sets[4]). As compared to Euclidean distance, Sørensen distance retains sensitivity in more heterogeneous data sets and gives less weight to outliers

This function assumes you pass in a and b as sets.

The sorensen index extended to abundance instead of incidence of species is called the Czekanowski index."

where m is the length of a and m is the length of b.

In information theory and computer science, the Levenshtein distance is a metric for measuring the amount of difference between two sequences (i.e., the so called edit distance). The Levenshtein distance between two strings is given by the minimum number of operations needed to transform one string into the other, where an operation is an insertion, deletion, or substitution of a single character.

For example, the Levenshtein distance between \"kitten\" and \"sitting\" is 3, since the following three edits change one into the other, and there is no way to do it with fewer than three edits:

   1. kitten → sitten (substitution of 's' for 'k')
   2. sitten → sittin (substitution of 'i' for 'e')
   3. sittin → sitting (insert 'g' at the end).

The Levenshtein distance has several simple upper and lower bounds that are useful in applications which compute many of them and compare them. These include:

    * It is always at least the difference of the sizes of the two strings.
    * It is at most the length of the longer string.
    * It is zero if and only if the strings are identical.
    * If the strings are the same size, the Hamming distance is an upper bound on the Levenshtein distance.
